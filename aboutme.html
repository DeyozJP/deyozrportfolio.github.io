                <h1>Hello! I am Deyoz</h1>
                <p>I am a data analyst and I help prepare, process, analyze, and communicate data to drive business.</p>

            <p>Hi, I'm Deyoz, a data scientist and data analyst currently working with SynergisticIT. I specialize in providing data analytical solutions to help clients solve their business problems.  In my current role, I completed several projects, workig with technologies such as Python, SQL, Azure ML, Azure Data Factory, Power BI, Tableau, Dash, and many more.  </p>
            <p>Previously, for about 8 years, I worked in finance, consulting, and academic fields in Nepal, I have had the opportunity to apply my education and skills to help others achieve their goals.</p>

            <p>Seeking to expand my knowledge and opportunities, I moved to New York to pursue a Master's degree in Business Analytics at CUNY Bernard M. Baruch College, graduated in May 2023. During my coursework, I collaborated with extraordinary individuals from diverse cultures and backgrounds on various analytics projects.</p>

            <p>These experiences allowed me to develop both hard and soft skills that are invaluable in problem-solving. My main areas of interest include data creation and preparation, statistical analysis, business intelligence, social media analytics, data visualization, optimization and simulations, machine learning, deep learning, and large language models for building natural language processing applications. You can view some of my recent works here.</p>

            <p>In addition to my analytics background, I hold a Master's degree in Project Management from Dortmund University of Arts and Sciences and numerous industry-recognized certifications.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy traveling to see nature, running and cycling to stay fit, playing the guitar for music and fun, and spending time with my dog, who is a wonderful companion.</p>

            <p>I am happy to connect with you!</p>
