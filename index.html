				        I developed a Document Question and Answering Application using LlamaIndex, ChromaDB, GPT-3.5 Turbo as a large language model, allowing users to upload documents (Word, PDF, text) and query them for information. This system, deployed on Render, is built with a frontend using Dash, HTML, and Bootstrap. Users can ask questions, get summaries, and extract specific details from documents using advanced natural language processing techniques. The project leverages ChromaDB for persistent storage of vector indices and provides a user-friendly web application interface. This app is available for anyone to use, showcasing my ability to integrate various technologies to create a functional and efficient NLP-based solution for document analysis.

                                    <p>The project's analysis of product review data highlights actionable insights crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and business ratings. Through a systematic approach involving data exploration, question formulation, and advanced data preparation using a Hugging Face pretrained model for zero-shot learning, the project categorized customer feedback into key aspects like comfortability and fitting.</p>
					    <p>The interactive dashboard developed with Plotly and Dash effectively communicates these insights, emphasizing positive aspects such as comfortability in clothing. However, a notable finding reveals that negative reviews predominantly stem from the 20-30 age group, citing issues with poor fitting in dresses and tops. This insight underscores the importance of focusing on improving fitting for this demographic segment to address critical customer concerns and enhance overall product satisfaction. By leveraging these findings, businesses can strategically prioritize improvements to maintain strengths and effectively address customer pain points, thereby fostering continuous enhancement in product offerings and customer experience.

				        In this project, we used Python to conduct the A/B test to determine if the new version of the checkout page increases customer purchases. We used step-by-step to perform the test.  After selecting a metric that measures the improvement, design parameters such as sample size are estimated,  EDA is performed, data is cleaned, sanity checks for validating data are performed, and test is conducted.

I employed principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and evaluated multiple machine learning regressors using lazy predictor. Despite the competitive performance of other models, the simplicity and effectiveness of linear regression led to further fine-tuning and evaluation. Diagnostic tests and visual inspections confirmed the model's efficacy in predicting real estate prices accurately.</p>

                                    <p>In this project, I utilized ARIMA to construct a predictive model for forecasting Meta's stock price. The ARIMA model effectively captured short-term trends and variations, making it suitable for predicting Meta's stock price over approximately 30 days with reasonable accuracy. </p> <p>The project features a step-by-step implementation of ARIMA, starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying patterns. Parameter estimation for the ARIMA model was guided by Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots, ensuring the selection of appropriate model orders.</p>

				<p>Throughout the project, diagnostic checks were performed to validate the ARIMA model's accuracy. These checks included visual inspection of residuals and model performance against actual stock prices. The robustness of the model was further assessed through residual analysis and comparison with historical data trends. While the ARIMA model demonstrated strong predictive performance for short-term forecasting, its application for longer-term predictions was cautioned due to the inherent volatility of financial markets.</p>

We developed classifier models: decision tree, naive bayes, xg-boost and deep learning neural networks models using historical data to predict banking customers' churn. Based on the performace metrices, XG boost performed better with abount 80 percent accuracy and precision. We also grouped customers into several bivariate clusters, using k-means clustering, which we used to analyze the profile of churning and non-churning customers. We found that churn rate is very high in customers of age above 35, which is a serious concern.</p>

                                    <p>Exploring the case of NarxCare, an opioid risk tool, this project discusses how machining learning algorithms inherit bias and what impact they make on some categorical people. Also, it provides some recommendations to the developer that can help to eradicate bias or minimize the negative impacts. </p>

                                    <p>In this project, we performed the exploratory data analysis of 14 days’ worth of mobile ad clicks dataset. We developed, trained, and evaluated models using Naive Bayes, XG Boost, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Logistic Regression. The main feature of this project is to show how to transform the categorical variables that have many values to make one-hot encoding an inappropriate method of transformation. Another highlight of this project is how to determine the optimum threshold for classification and present the trade-offs between recall and precession.</p>
                                    <p> We did not create a balanced dataset. Instead, train and test on an imbalanced original dataset to reflect reality. Based on the evaluation, XG Boost and Gradient Boost have much better AUC than that of other models. However, we selected XG Boost on the grounds of resource requirement as Gradient Boost consumes a lot of resources.</p>
                                    <p>We further evaluated the model using the cumulative gain chart and lift curve, which shows that selecting the top 20 % of the leads ranked as most likely to respond to an ad will contain about 55% of the actual click. The expected baseline number without using the model would only be 20%. Therefore, the model adds business value. </p>
